- Ship Placement Documentation -

Programming Method:
ship_placement.ipynb was made in Jupyter Notebook. ship_placement.py is its regular Python equivalent and either should function fine on its own.

Plan:
This program was designed to place ships in a 10x10 array, requiring player number, ship size, and orientation.

Changes:
9/11/24 - The program creates a temporary 10x10 array consisting of 0's. This could be removed and replaced with the array used by the rest of the team fairly easily. Ships are placed based by the top-leftmost corner. The player inputs the position (e.g., A6). The program uses loops, and it increments through the array, changing the 0's into the ship size's number, representing it. This can be done because each ship size is unique. The program increments until it has done the length of the ship size.

9/15/24 - My program has been integrated into the main program with some slight changes made.

Things To Note:
9/11/24 - It may need to check for some errors. The responsibility of checking to see if it's valid was not given to me, but it may still need to check for errors in regards to player number, ship size, or orientation. An error could also occur if a player inputs an invalid position (i.e., out of range, lowercase numbers, or different spacing).
